    "Our team chose to research the novel Coronavirus. In 2020 SARS-CoV-2 began spreading across the world and there has been an widespread effort to understand the virus and research ways to combat it. Bioinformatics takes the forefront in understanding the genetic makeup of the virus and its mutations. Our contributions to the research into understanding SARS-CoV-2 include tracing similarities between SARS-CoV-2 and two viruses that have previously spread. These two viruses are SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. Much of our research and data collection involved taking sequences of these three viruses and examining the relationships between them in order to extract data to determine similarities and differences between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used in our research came from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The NCBI contains a vast amount of bioinformatics related databases including several databases which contain virus specific DNA sequences. The database that we focused our data extraction on was the NCBIâ€©",

    "After successfully collecting sequence data for SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV, we analyzed the similarities and differences between example sequences of each of the viruses. We wanted to expand upon this research and begin looking into mutations of SARS-CoV-2 that have appeared since the initial identification. The specific mutation that we focused on is the D614G mutation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The D614G mutation is an A-to-G missense mutation at position 23,403 that causes the substitution of aspartic acid with glycine (1). This causes a change in the structure of the viral spike glycoprotein. Virus with this mutation has since been named clade G and was first detected on January 21, 2020 (2). Due to the increasing global dominance of clade G, it is suspected that it increases susceptibility. A study found retroviruses with SG614 infected ACE2-expressing cells marked more efficiently than those with SD614 (6). It was initially mainly prevalent in European regions (1). In Italy there was an outbreak during the early stage of the global pandemic, resulting in 400 deaths in one month (3). 87% of samples taken from Italy were found to have the D614G mutation.\n",
    "\n",
    "California will be used as a case study. Samples will be taken from patients with Covid-19 all over California, and the prevalence of the D614G mutation among the California population can be deduced. We have randomly selected 30 samples from the NCBI, and searched for mutations on the spike glycoprotein (S protein) (5). Since the mutation has been more commonly found in Europe, it would likely have been introduced to the California population later on. The presence of the D614G mutation among Californian cases could infer increased infectivity.\n"

    "### Smith-Waterman Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Our implementation began with the comparison between SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV. In order to perform these comparisons we utilized the Smith-Waterman Algorithm. Earlier research performed to analyze the similarities and differences between the viruses utilized the Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm which finds the optimal global alignment of sequences. However, our decision to use Smith-Waterman came from its impressive ability to find the best local alignment. We use the individual local alignment scores to draw conclusions about overall viral genome similarity; i.e., if all local alignments exhibit high similarity and local alignments take up a large proportion of the genome then the two genomes are likely to be quite similar.\n",
